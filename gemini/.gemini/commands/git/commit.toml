description = "Generates a Conventional Commit message from staged changes and executes the commit."

prompt = """
Analyze the staged changes and commit them using the Conventional Commits (Commitizen) format.

Follow these steps:

1. Use `git diff --cached` to retrieve the currently staged changes.
   - **Critical:** If the output is empty, stop immediately and inform me that there are no staged changes to commit.
2. Analyze the logic and intent of the code changes.
3. Generate a concise commit message following the format: `type(scope): description`.
   - **Types:** feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, perf, test, build, ci, chore, revert.
   - **Style:** Use the imperative mood (e.g., "change" not "changed"), lower case, and no period at the end.
4. Execute the commit using `git commit -m "YOUR_GENERATED_MESSAGE"`.

Remember to use the Shell tool for all git interactions.
